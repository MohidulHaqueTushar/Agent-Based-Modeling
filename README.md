## Agent-Based-Modeling

Simulation of an agent-based model of multi-level selection.
This simulation shows two outcomes:
    1. without group selection pressures (without war/without groups conflict), 
       Non-Altruistic population will increase over time. 
    2. Under the pressures of group selection (with war/with groups conflict),
       Altruistic population will increase over time.
