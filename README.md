## Agent-Based-Modeling

Simulation of an agent-based model of multi-level group selection under a controlled environment.

**This simulation shows two outcomes:**

    1. Without group selection pressures (without war/without group conflict), 
       Non-Altruistic populations will increase over time. 
       
    2. Under the pressures of group selection (with war/with groups conflict),
       The altruistic population will increase over time.
